# Winforms-MVP-Test
A Sample WinForms application with an implementation of the Model View Presenter design pattern. I am no loner actively developing on this repo. Everything is basically implemented with the exception of a few extra things that could be handled better in the UI. This repo is intended to be used as a code model for abstracting form behind code in a presenter.
